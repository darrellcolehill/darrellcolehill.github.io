        `**Overview:** This project involves transforming a bike I found in the garbage into an interactive game controller by integrating various sensors with an Arduino microcontroller.
        
**Key Features:**
- **RPM Detection:** Measures the bike's speed to control the game's velocity parameters.
- **Handle Bar Position Detection:** Detects changes in the handlebar position and maps it to left/right player movement.
- **Minimally Invasive:** Can use the bike normally should I decide that I want to actually touch grass.`,
